# the command will stash changes and pull origin, then fallback changes (-s)
# then add all changes in src/
# create a commit with message: "feat: a new feature"
# push to origin (-p)

# e.g.2:
msc -s
# the command will ask for some questions to complete commit message
# then stash changes and pull origin, then fallback changes
# create commit with comments

# e.g.3
msc
# the command will ask for some questions to complete commit message
# create commit with comments
# without option "-p", it wouldn't push to origin, you need to run "git push" by yourself
```
